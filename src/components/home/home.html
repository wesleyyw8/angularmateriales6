	      <h2>Pre-Rendered Dialog</h2>
	      <p>
	        This is a pre-rendered dialog, which means that <code>$mdDialog</code> doesn't compile its
	        template on each opening.
	        <br/><br/>
	        The Dialog Element is a static element in the DOM, which is just visually hidden.<br/>
	        Once the dialog opens, we just fetch the element from the DOM into our dialog and upon close
	        we restore the element back into its old DOM position.
	      </p>
